It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body). Before learning the Java abstract class, let's understand the abstraction in Java first. Abstraction in Java Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user. Another way, it shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details, for example, sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery. Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it. Ways to achieve Abstraction There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java Abstract class (0 to 100%) Interface (100%) Abstract class in Java A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated. Points to Remember An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It cannot be instantiated. It can have constructors and static methods also. It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method. Example of abstract class 
abstract class A{}
 Abstract Method in Java A method which is declared as abstract and does not have implementation is known as an abstract method. Example of abstract method 
abstract void printStatus();//no method body and abstract
 Example of Abstract class that has an abstract method In this example, Bike is an abstract class that contains only one abstract method run. Its implementation is provided by the Honda class. 
 abstract class Bike{
   abstract void run();
 }
 class Honda4 extends Bike{
 void run(){System.out.println("running safely");}
 public static void main(String args[]){
  Bike obj = new Honda4();
  obj.run();
 }
 }
 Test it Now 
running safely
 Understanding the real scenario of Abstract class In this example, Shape is the abstract class, and its implementation is provided by the Rectangle and Circle classes. Mostly, we don't know about the implementation class (which is hidden to the end user), and an object of the implementation class is provided by the factory method. A factory method is a method that returns the instance of the class. We will learn about the factory method later. In this example, if you create the instance of Rectangle class, draw() method of Rectangle class will be invoked. File: TestAbstraction1.java 
abstract class Shape{
abstract void draw();
}
//In real scenario, implementation is provided by others i.e. unknown by end user
class Rectangle extends Shape{
void draw(){System.out.println("drawing rectangle");}
}
class Circle1 extends Shape{
void draw(){System.out.println("drawing circle");}
}
//In real scenario, method is called by programmer or user
class TestAbstraction1{
public static void main(String args[]){
Shape s=new Circle1();//In a real scenario, object is provided through method, e.g., getShape() method
s.draw();
}
}
 Test it Now 
drawing circle
 Another example of Abstract class in java File: TestBank.java 
abstract class Bank{  
abstract int getRateOfInterest();  
}  
class SBI extends Bank{  
int getRateOfInterest(){return 7;}  
}  
class PNB extends Bank{  
int getRateOfInterest(){return 8;}  
}  
  
class TestBank{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Bank b;
b=new SBI();
System.out.println("Rate of Interest is: "+b.getRateOfInterest()+" %");  
b=new PNB();
System.out.println("Rate of Interest is: "+b.getRateOfInterest()+" %");  
}}  
 Test it Now 
Rate of Interest is: 7 %
Rate of Interest is: 8 %
 Abstract class having constructor, data member and methods An abstract class can have a data member, abstract method, method body (non-abstract method), constructor, and even main() method. File: TestAbstraction2.java 
//Example of an abstract class that has abstract and non-abstract methods
 abstract class Bike{
   Bike(){System.out.println("bike is created");}
   abstract void run();
   void changeGear(){System.out.println("gear changed");}
 }
//Creating a Child class which inherits Abstract class
 class Honda extends Bike{
 void run(){System.out.println("running safely..");}
 }
//Creating a Test class which calls abstract and non-abstract methods
 class TestAbstraction2{
 public static void main(String args[]){
  Bike obj = new Honda();
  obj.run();
  obj.changeGear();
 }
}
 Test it Now 
       bike is created
       running safely..
       gear changed
 Rule: If there is an abstract method in a class, that class must be abstract. 
   class Bike12{
   abstract void run();
   }
 Test it Now 
compile time error
 Rule: If you are extending an abstract class that has an abstract method, you must either provide the implementation of the method or make this class abstract. Another real scenario of abstract class The abstract class can also be used to provide some implementation of the interface. In such case, the end user may not be forced to override all the methods of the interface. Note: If you are beginner to java, learn interface first and skip this example. 
interface A{
void a();
void b();
void c();
void d();
}

abstract class B implements A{
public void c(){System.out.println("I am c");}
}

class M extends B{
public void a(){System.out.println("I am a");}
public void b(){System.out.println("I am b");}
public void d(){System.out.println("I am d");}
}

class Test5{
public static void main(String args[]){
A a=new M();
a.a();
a.b();
a.c();
a.d();
}}
 Test it Now 
Output:I am a
       I am b
       I am c
       I am d
