A variable is assigned with a data type. Variable is a name of memory location. There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static. There are two types of data types in Java: primitive and non-primitive. Variable Variable is name of reserved area allocated in memory. In other words, it is a name of memory location. It is a combination of "vary + able" that means its value can be changed. 
int data=50;//Here data is variable
 Types of Variables There are three types of variables in Java: local variable instance variable static variable 1) Local Variable A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable. You can use this variable only within that method and the other methods in the class aren't even aware that the variable exists. A local variable cannot be defined with "static" keyword. 2) Instance Variable A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called instance variable. It is not declared as static. It is called instance variable because its value is instance specific and is not shared among instances. 3) Static variable A variable which is declared as static is called static variable. It cannot be local. You can create a single copy of static variable and share among all the instances of the class. Memory allocation for static variable happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory. Example to understand the types of variables in java 
class A{
int data=50;//instance variable
static int m=100;//static variable
void method(){
int n=90;//local variable
}
}//end of class
 Java Variable Example: Add Two Numbers 
class Simple{
public static void main(String[] args){
int a=10;
int b=10;
int c=a+b;
System.out.println(c);
}}
 Output: 
20
 Java Variable Example: Widening 
class Simple{
public static void main(String[] args){
int a=10;
float f=a;
System.out.println(a);
System.out.println(f);
}}
 Output: 
10
10.0
 Java Variable Example: Narrowing (Typecasting) 
class Simple{
public static void main(String[] args){
float f=10.5f;
//int a=f;//Compile time error
int a=(int)f;
System.out.println(f);
System.out.println(a);
}}
 Output: 
10.5
10
 Java Variable Example: Overflow 
class Simple{
public static void main(String[] args){
//Overflow
int a=130;
byte b=(byte)a;
System.out.println(a);
System.out.println(b);
}}
 Output: 
130
-126
 Java Variable Example: Adding Lower Type 
class Simple{
public static void main(String[] args){
byte a=10;
byte b=10;
//byte c=a+b;//Compile Time Error: because a+b=20 will be int
byte c=(byte)(a+b);
System.out.println(c);
}}
 Output: 
20
