IMAP is an advanced protocol for receiving messages. It provides support for multiple mail box for each user ,in addition to, mailbox can be shared by multiple users. It is defined in RFC 2060. MIME Multiple Internet Mail Extension (MIME) tells the browser what is being sent e.g. attachment, format of the messages etc. It is not known as mail transfer protocol but it is used by your mail program. NNTP and Others There are many protocols that are provided by third-party providers. Some of them are Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) etc. JavaMail Architecture The java application uses JavaMail API to compose, send and receive emails.
